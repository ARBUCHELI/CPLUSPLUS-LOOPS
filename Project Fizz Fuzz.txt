* Fizz Buzz
-----------
Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a cliché!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding 
knowledge to solve simple problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Write a fizzbuzz.cpp program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz.

* What we are building in the project:
--------------------------------------
1.
As the inventor of this challenge, Imran Ghory, states:
-------------------------------------------------------

"After a fair bit of trial and error I’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code don’t just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write an implementation of 
a linked list). They struggle with tiny problems. 

So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call “FizzBuzz Questions” named after a game children often play (or are 
made to play) in schools in the UK.”

Setting up:
-----------
2.
Let’s create a skeleton for the program. Add:

#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
 
  // Brain explodes here:
 
}

Hint
In order to read or write to the standard input/output streams, you need to include:

#include <iostream>
The main() is the main function that houses your program.

Outputs numbers from 1 to 100:
------------------------------
3.
How do we output all the numbers from 1 to 100?

Well, we could write std::cout 100 times back to back but that’s no fun. What else can we do?

That’s right! A for loop!

Write a for loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100.


Hint
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
 
  // We will write the code here
 
}
4.
Inside the for loop, let’s output the counter i.


Hint
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
 
  std::cout << i << "\n";
 
}
Your output should now look like:

1
2
3
4
5
.
.
.
100
5.
And now we have all the numbers. Let’s solve the hard part.

Before coding further, take out a piece of paper and brainstorm.

How do we check for whether or not a number is divisible by 3?

Hint: You will need a if/else if/else statement for this and also the modulo % operator!

When you are ready, try to implement it.


Hint
It’s not a true test of your abilities if you look at other people’s answers or Google for examples — try to solve this yourself as if you were in a job interview situation.

If i is a multiple of 3, then the condition i % 3 == 0 will be true.

You might need to do the same for 5 and 15.
